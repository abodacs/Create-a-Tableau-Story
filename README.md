# Prosper Loan Data visualization using Tableau

## About

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with those people who have the money to invest. In this data analysis project, In my Tableau story I have done exploration on the relationship between loans and the people acquiring them, the reasons for taking out a loan and who defaults the most. I have given a brief insight into the people acquiring loans by looking at the debt levels by state as well as the amount of money borrowed over the past few years looking at whether or not people were homeowners. I explored the reasons that people have for taking out loans as well as who is most likely to default based on their occupation and income range. Breaking down the number of defaulters by occupation it seems that college student have the highest borrower and default rates.

## Summary

Personal online loan business has been an important way for borrowers to raise money and for investors to earn interest. However, the risk of this type of investment is definitely higher than T-bills, T-notes and T-bonds, so it’s important to address the default risk for this business. In this story, we explored many aspects for personal loan business based on the [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/plp/about/contact-us/) Loan Dataset, including the default rates across different states of US, sereval factors which have clear impact on default rate, etc. Moreover, this analysis showed that higher risk loans don’t guarantee higher return so a useful tip for investors was given
